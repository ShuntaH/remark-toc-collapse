## What is this?
This is a simple plugin that places a table of contents generated by remark-toc inside a details element.


## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`:

```markdown
## Table of contents

# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
#### Heading level 4
```

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkTocCollapse from 'remark-toc-collapse'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkTocCollapse)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.log(String(file))
}
```

yields:

```markdown
<details>

<summary>

## Table of contents

</summary>

*   [Heading level 1](#heading-level-1)

  *   [Heading level 2](#heading-level-2)

    *   [Heading level 3](#heading-level-3)

      *   [Heading level 4](#heading-level-4)

</details>
```
